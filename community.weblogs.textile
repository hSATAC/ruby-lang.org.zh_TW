h3. Blogs of Note

A few notable blogs stand out for the frequency and immediacy of their updates.

* "*Riding Rails*":http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/ is the official group blog of the Ruby on Rails team.  If you are running Rails, this blog is essential for notification of security updates and an overall view of the wide Rails community.
* "*Ruby Inside*":http://www.rubyinside.com/ announces interesting applications and libraries from throughout the world, both Ruby and Rails.
* "*Matz' Blog*":http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/ is a Japanese blog written by Ruby's creator.  Even if you can't read all of it, it's good to know he's right there!
* "*Rails Envy*":http://railsenvy.com/ is a blog and podcast where you can learn a lot about what's going on in Rails and just plain Ruby.  They have a good video collection too, where you can fast-forward through popular Ruby events or just be entertained.

h3. Spreading the Word

If you've got a Ruby blog you've started, it's wise to link the blog on "del.icio.us":http://del.icio.us with the _ruby_ tag.  You might also contact the weblogs above, if you are covering a topic they'd be interested in.  (Obviously, if it's not Rails-related, then the _Riding Rails_ crew may not be as interested -- but you never know.)

Ruby is also a common topic on both "Digg":http://digg.com/programming and "Slashdot":http://developers.slashdot.org/, in their respective programming news.  If you find some brilliant code out there, be sure to let them know!
